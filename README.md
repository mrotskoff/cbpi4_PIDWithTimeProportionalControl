A PID Controller for CraftBeerPi4 Kettles that uses Time Proportioning for output.

This is useful for gas burners whose output is controlled as either ON or OFF.  The PID output is converted into a proportion of the specified interval due ng which the burner is turned on or off.  This also helps control jitter (rapid firing of the burner) to preserve equipment.
